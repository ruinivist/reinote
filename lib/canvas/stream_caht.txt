Welcome to the chat room!
New
ruinivist: all good now
ruinivist: my setup looks so cool
ruinivist: change of plans
ruinivist: lets for now go for an all in 2d layout
ruinivist: full custom

qeqpep0: hihi
ruinivist: lol how did u reach here
ruinivist: hi
qeqpep0: this category is pretty smoll
qeqpep0: not hard to scroll
ruinivist: what u up to then
qeqpep0: work. after checking in w/you :|
qeqpep0: :-l
ruinivist: work on the weekend
ruinivist: enjoy
qeqpep0: eeh. as unemployed person i call everything work and too hard to do
ruinivist: lol
qeqpep0: are you learning smth new rn?
ruinivist: what I need to do now is draw all the widgets on a 2d plane, there's no "widget" as such for this so got to use a RenderObject but then things get tricky as you literally have to position and draw everything along with the scroll

Replying to @qeqpep0: are you learning smth new rn?
ruinivist: eh kinda, i know this framework mostly
ruinivist: but the things required for this app are new
ruinivist: tbh what I am trying to do now lies into game engine terittory too much
ruinivist: but we'll see, its a hobby project anyway
ruinivist: its basically something like one note except that the nodes are constrained on axes
qeqpep0: when you scroll, some nodes don't move?
qeqpep0: node is a note?
ruinivist: yep

Replying to @qeqpep0: when you scroll, some nodes don't move?
ruinivist: nope see it as a 2d grid, there's no arbitary positions as in I cannot place something diagonally
ruinivist: exactly like this comment
ruinivist: except I want to be able to focus on the note by swiping
qeqpep0: ok. i see
ruinivist: and I want that one note/excalidraw like free pan as wel
ruinivist: its just the placements that I define to not be arbitary
qeqpep0: infinite canvas is how i'd like to add notes to my knowledge base
qeqpep0: good luck
ruinivist: ty
ruinivist: obsidian has that and few other apps too
ruinivist: but there's stuff I want that not in there
qeqpep0: like?
ruinivist: i'm a bit opinioated on the way I want to arrange them
ruinivist: let me explain
ruinivist: i want it like a journal, a local twitter feed kind of
ruinivist: so when you "post" it adds new entry just like a linear feed
ruinivist: but say I want to elaborate on note2 I should be able to swipe right and continue
qeqpep0: yep
ruinivist: something like this
ruinivist: so up and down are branches
ruinivist: and right is progress on the branch
ruinivist: I can manually make it like this in obsidian dragging around
ruinivist: but I want this baked in
ruinivist: + i want an open source solution
ruinivist: obsidian is not anymore
qeqpep0: bruh
ruinivist: ?
qeqpep0: like, good that i stuck with org-roam
ruinivist: yep
ruinivist: I used joplin for the longest time
ruinivist: back now
ruinivist: i'll implement zoom as well before moving on

ruinivist: lol
ruinivist: nt
ruinivist: i'm curious where these links lead to
ruinivist: open in tor maybe LULE
ruinivist: how its been only 1.5 h
ruinivist: -__- well probably for the good
ruinivist: twitch break LULE
ruinivist: yeah looks like we are lagging as we get to a 1000 notes
ruinivist: assumed so as we literally paint it all
ruinivist: even if not on screen
ruinivist: i dont think I can fix skip layout but rest probably
ruinivist: looks like even layout is taking too much time
ruinivist: I was afraid this might happen and I don't seem to have a better solution for it
ruinivist: i doubt what claude says will work
ruinivist: wierd
ruinivist: i
ruinivist: i'm not painting anything yet its slow
ruinivist: is it simply that 1000 widgets are too big to pass?
qeqpep0: is there a profiler
ruinivist: there is
ruinivist: i'm not a 100% sure if it'll help here, ig I can try
ruinivist: in any case the current approach is not scalable
ruinivist: i need that 60fps
ruinivist: atleast
qeqpep0: how will you select which notes to draw? instead of all
qeqpep0: is dart object oriented?
ruinivist: yep
ruinivist: I can always have one note that I know was rendered, starting with first paint
ruinivist: then tracking offset changes I know at each time which ones need to be drawn
ruinivist: right now the problem is with api, I don't know it all that well

Replying to @ruinivist: then tracking offset changes I know at each time which ones need to be drawn
ruinivist: as long as keep the sizes of each note widget fixed or discrete based on quickly calculated param
ruinivist: missed that

Replying to @ruinivist: as long as keep the sizes of each note widget fixed or discrete based on quickly calculated param
ruinivist: link string size
ruinivist: brb, current impl is a bit buggy but we got back to good perf with rendering only whats in view as long as I know the size of each note widget
ruinivist: which can't be avoided because otherwise you have to do layout for all to know which to draw and in that case it would obviously blow up
ruinivist: sizes could be discrete though as in I can make a small, mid large note based on string len and any larger would open in a new window
ruinivist: or overlay on top
ruinivist: lol new issue now, not too big though
ruinivist: I don't know what the source of dfs is gonna be
ruinivist: while panning across
ruinivist: ig i can just take whatever was last visible as source
ruinivist: oh I get it I do get the correct children but my positioning algo currently depends on the order of children which is why it flips all the time
ruinivist: plus the picking algo is a bit messed up as well
ruinivist: since I need positions anyway
ruinivist: I need to build a separate graph layer that will be the oracle positions
ruinivist: in the absolute sense
ruinivist: then I can always figure out the centre of screen based on offset and find that of the visible nodes, which would be few, which one is the closest to centre
